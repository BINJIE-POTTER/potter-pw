# Hi there

My name is **Binjie Ye** and I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the **University of British Columbia** (UBC). My hobbies are 
- working out 🏋, 
- playing badminton 🏸, 
- hiking 🚶, 
- and video gaming 🎮.

In terms of professional interests, I'm passionate about **hardware coding, algorithm design and application, as well as machine learning**. Even though website development hasn't been a primary focus, I always strive to step outside my comfort zone and explore new areas of learning, just like this one.

Over the past two years of my university journey, I have had the opportunity to work with a diverse group of friends and classmates on various projects. These experiences have enriched my perspective and helped me become a more well-rounded individual.

Please feel free to explore this website to learn more about me. For a detailed overview of my [skills](/skills), [projects](/projects), and additional information, please feel free to click on the relevant sections or headings provided above. Thank you for visiting!
